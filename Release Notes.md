A take on the Angry Birds formula.  Here the objective is to free your alien
friends from the dungeons of a Castle.  The player gets to build the castle in
the Editor mode and gets to knock it down in the Play mode.

####**How to Use**
---------
Because Castles & UFO Editor interacts with a server, the game will not run if
you run the file from index.html.  Instead, our files can be found on the
Perforce depot in the following directory:

//VFS_Depot/Programming/PG09/Team/AngryPigs/SexyLetterJs/

####**Known Issues**
--------
Very poor support for Firefox.  Rendering issues galore.
